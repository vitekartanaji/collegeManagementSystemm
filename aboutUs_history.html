    <h3>History</h3>
    <div>
        <p> Solapur is one of the drought-prone districts of Maharashtra State. Agriculture is the main source of its
            income and livelyhood. Out of the eleven talukas of the </p>
        <p> district, Sangola taluka suffers from high intensity of drought, which has resulted into its economic,
            political, industrial and educational backwardness. Sangola town</p>
        <p>is the headquarters of the taluka. With a strong conviction that education, and especially higher education,
            works as an engine of all round development of any </p>
        <p> region, local vanguards like<i><b> Late Dadasaheb Shende, Late Bapusaheb Zapke, Late Bajrangaba Lokhande</b>
            </i> and others established a society named as<b> Sangola Taluka</p>
        <p>Uchha Shikshan Mandal, Sangola in 1970 </b>in order to facilitate imparting of higher education. Previously
            students of this taluka had to go to Pune, Solapur, Sangli and </p>
        <p>Kolhapur for their higher education, which was a very costly affaire for them. Pioneers of the College
            brought higher education at doorstep of common man.</p>
        <p><span>"ज्ञानदीप लावू जगी"</span>(Let us lit the light of knowledge) is the motto of the institution. Keeping
            this in mind society established a College by </p>
        <p>name Sangola College, Sangola in 1978.</p><br>

        <p>The College was started with two figure number of students and at present the number has reached to four
            figures. Initially only Arts faculty was opened in 1978,</p>
        <p>followed by Commerce faculty in 1981. Science faculty was introduced in 1991. Considering the need of time
            new courses like B.C.S, B.C.A. were started in 2000 and</p>
        <p>2003 respectively. It is a matter of proud that our College is pioneer in introducing B.C.S. course in
            Shivaji University, Kolhapur. The College marched one step ahead</p>
        <p>with post-graduate teaching in Marathi and Hindi in 1995. Considering the need of post-graduate in computer
            science we started M.Sc(Computer Science) in 2003.</p>
        <p>The students are drawn from Sangola and peripheral rural area. Hence, the College has to make to pull them up
            to the common level. Effort of the faculty are</p>
        <p>rewarding. Some of our students have emerged as rank-holders in the University examinations. As well as
            number of students are working in software Industries in</p>
        <p>various multi-national organizations. Up till now twelve students of N.C.C. unit were selected to take part
            in R. D. parade in New Delhi. Also in sports we get number of</p>
        <p>awards as well as our some student's are members of state and national teams in various events.</p>
